LeetCode has over 2000 questions,

If you just practice randomly you won't feel confident or maybe you don't cover all important concepts.

This is why using lists/selected questions is the best way to prepare for coding interviews!

These are some of my top list recommendations ðŸ™‚

1. takeUforward SDE sheet (https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/), it is a concise list of 200+ problems.

2. LeetCode top-interview-cards, the contain problems sorted by topics and difficulty.'

3. Leetcode patterns by Sean Prashad, he covers problems not by topics but by patterns, an interesting way to go about practicing!

4. Blind 75 (https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions), small list of important leetcode problems for end moment preparation!

## Instead of learning solutions of LeetCode questions, understand patterns! ðŸ™‚

For ex.

If input array is sorted then
- Binary search
- Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
- Backtracking

If given a tree then
- DFS
- BFS

If given a graph then
- DFS
- BFS

If given a linked list then
- Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
- Stack

If must solve in-place then
- Swap corresponding values
- Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options then
- Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
- Heap

If asked for common strings then
- Map
- Trie

Else
- Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
- Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
